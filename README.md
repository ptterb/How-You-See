How You See
===========

*How You See* is an interactive kiosk created by [Tom Arthur](http://itp.howtomworks.com), [Xuedi Chen](http://xc-xd.com), [Hannah Mishin](http://hannahmishin.com) & [Brett Peterson](http://brettjpeterson.com) for the NYU Interactive Telecommunication Program 2013 Spring Show.

Special thanks to Dr. Anthony Movshon, Ph.D, Jeremy Freeman, Ph.D & Corey Ziemba, B.S. for patiently explaining the neuroscience to us.

This application is written in openFrameworks and uses a webcam and kinect to illustrate how your brain processes what you see. 

Addons needed to run include: [ofxKinect](https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxKinect), [ofxOpenCV](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/addons/ofxOpenCv), [ofxFX](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/ofxFX).
